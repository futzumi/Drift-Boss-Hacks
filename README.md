# Note
- This hack has only been tested at https://www.mathplayground.com/drift-boss-v3/index.html. If you find a website where it does not work, create an issue.
- EVERY SINGLE hack on this page was developed by me and me only. Since i doubt anyone will be able to deobfuscate the code to the hacks apart from the save editor, I'm the only one in the world with the raw code. In the future i will be adding a GUI for this hack and by then i will have my watermark up and running.
# Features
- Slow Car Speed</br>
This method was created by futzumi and it can be explained in a few simple steps. First, I edit the users data to trick the game into thinking you don't have the fire truck unlocked. Next, you are able to buy the car back for free. Finally, Once the fire truck is back into your data, the contents of the car are edited to half speed(15) instead of default speed(30).
- Infinite Plane</br>
Another method by futzumi. While in a game, running this script will trick the game into thinking you're doing the tutorial. While in reality, you're stacking up your score. This method changes the camera angle and may also cause the car to glitch.
